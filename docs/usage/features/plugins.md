# Plugin System

KiraAI supports rich plugin extensions, allowing you to easily customize and enhance the functionality of AI digital life.

## What is a Plugin?

A plugin is a modular extension that allows you to add new features to KiraAI without modifying the core code. Each plugin can provide specific functionality, expanding the capabilities of digital life.

## Plugin Features

### Event Hooks

Plugins can listen to system events at every stage of message processing — from receiving an IM message, through LLM processing, to sending replies. This allows plugins to inject prompts, modify responses, and react to system events.

### Custom Tools

Plugins can register callable tools that the LLM can invoke during conversations. For example, a search plugin can register a `web_search` tool that the LLM calls when it needs to look up information.

### Custom Tags

Plugins can register custom XML tag handlers. When the LLM outputs XML tags (e.g., `<sticker>`), the corresponding handler processes them into message elements like images or audio.

### REST API Endpoints

Plugins can expose HTTP API endpoints via FastAPI, enabling external systems to interact with the plugin.

### WebUI Pages

Plugins can register custom web pages that are embedded into KiraAI's WebUI, with built-in theme adaptation and a Bridge SDK for seamless frontend-backend communication.

### Configuration System

Plugins can define a configuration schema (`schema.json`) with 15+ field types, providing a rich settings UI in the WebUI without writing any frontend code.

## Builtin Plugins

KiraAI ships with several builtin plugins:

| Plugin          | Description                                      |

| `kira-ai`       | XML tag injection and LLM response auto-repair   |
| `memory`        | Long-term memory management for the AI           |
| `sticker`       | Sticker/emoji support in conversations           |
| `search`        | Web search capability for the LLM                |
| `file`          | File operations (read, write, list)              |
| `session_tools` | Cross-session awareness and management           |
